# RISC-V-pipelined-processor
Our project supports all RISC-VI 40 instructions as well as the 8 RISCV32M multiplication and division instructions. 
- All R-format instructions
- All I-format instructions
- All load and store instructions
- All branching instructions
- AUIPC, LUI, JAL and JALR
- Fence, Ecall, and Ebreak
- All the 8 multiplication and division instruction

Our processor is single memory and executes a pipeline stage every half cycle to be able to implement the single memory.
